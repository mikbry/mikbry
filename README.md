### Hi there ! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github account ðŸ˜‰

ðŸ”­ I am currently involved in several personal open-source projects. Where I experiment, learn and push back the limits:
- [JTyper](https://github.com/mikbry/jtyper/projects/1) : Data computing in browser using modern Javascript and soon GPU/WASM/Rust
- [Ziiircom](https://github.com/mikbry/Ziiircom/projects/1) : Create the most advanced webchat toolkit to integrate in your app/web
- [material-ui-color](https://github.com/mikbry/material-ui-color) : How to do top-notch Material-ui components with minimal dependencies and ressources
- [din-o](https://github.com/mikbry/din-o) : Deno + Webrtc solution for webconf, at an early stage.
- And more

Also I work for clients on cutting-edge mobile/web apps involving video-processing and AI.
As a developer, as a lead or as a CTO, I bring my long experience in coding using different languages (Javascript, Java, Swift / Objective-C, C/C++, PHP, Python) and managing projects and people as efficiently as possible.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust/WebGPU/WASM and some new AI concepts.
 
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m open to collaboration on cool projects involving AI, video and or 3D.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about any tricky problems in your React, React-native, Android or iOs app or backend. I put misfit projects on the right track.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently involved in several personal opensource projects:
- [JTyper](https://github.com/mikbry/jtyper/projects/1)
- [Ziiircom](https://github.com/mikbry/Ziiircom/projects/1)
- [material-ui-color](https://github.com/mikbry/material-ui-color)
- And more

Also I work for clients on mobile/web apps around video-processing, AI and B2B.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust and some new AI concepts.
 
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on complex projects using AI, video and 3D 

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about any tricky problems in your javascript, Android or iOs app. I put a misfit project on right tracks.
